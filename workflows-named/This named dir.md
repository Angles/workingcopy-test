# This `Workflows-named folder`

## Update - these are old ;)

---

**Apparently, this started off as a good idea, but it is not so easy to tell new workflows from one device with eponymously named workflows on the other, which need to be moved thereto. Furthermore, GitHub apparently considers these ` .wflow ` as binary files. Thus, granular changes, obvious in plain text files, are here quite opaque - What has changed? The commit comment has not the room to hold enough info to make obvious which workflows need to be updated on the device of the other.**


Both **Workflow** and **Working Copy** are excellent apps, breaking new ground for iOS based developers. I hate having to use a tiny, broken old MacBook Air, with a tiny SSD drive and small screen, when I can do *nearly* the same on an iPad or iPhone, the latter I have with me anyway, it is a phone after all.


Thus, when **and if** I make changes to this `.MD` file in the future, it will be obvious. Text is code. Code is text. Workflows are cool. I always though OS X Automator and AppleScript we're fun. On 
 iOS devices the Workflow app is a breakthrough and provides hours of fun and 'profit' in productivity. **I already have `one press button solutions` TM ;) for the most heinous and tedious tasks.**


Nonetheless, 
## I miss really crazy shell scripts.
