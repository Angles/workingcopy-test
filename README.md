# workingcopy-test - What is here
Test repo for the **Working Copy** iOS app [link](http://workingcopyapp.com/) It works great.

It works so well I moved **workflows ` .wflow `** files to a dedicated repo. Anyway... what is here...

# Workflows, most moved to own repo, for workflow app

Also pushing some workflows for the Excellent iOS app **Workflow** [link](https://workflow.is)  The ` .wflow ` files are in the **workflows** folder. By the way, the app has a community site [here](https://workflow.is/community)

### subcolder workflows
This was where they went at first

### subfolder workflows-named
I got sick of putting version info in names of workflows themselves. I **tried** single name and updating them with consistent name. **But** it became hard to tell which was newest when changing to other devices.

### subfolder workflows-archive
I forget stuff and sometimes older workflows have more obvious info about how I made them. Useful in future to remember stuff. Stuff like that is saved here.

### subfolder other stuff
I put some useful unrelated info there, but being non-workflows, i would forget it in a sub folder. I moved them to base folder. But now github says this is an html repo. whatever.

### That is about it for now. 

# I have readme files
What is misspelled? I wrote this on iOS in a code editor mot a word processor. Spell check gets in the way with code.
